Unintended Household Energy Usage â€“ Data-Driven Analysis
This project explores unintended energy usage in households using data science and machine learning techniques. Built on a real-world dataset, it identifies inefficiencies in household energy consumption, predicts usage patterns, detects anomalies, and proposes actionable load-shifting strategies.

## Project Goals

- Detect **irregular or inefficient energy usage** in households
- Forecast future consumption trends using time-series models
- Identify appliance-level inefficiencies using clustering
- Propose **load-shifting strategies** to reduce costs and peak demand
- Apply ML models to evaluate forecasting accuracy

## Techniques & Models Used

- Time-Series Forecasting: **ARIMA**
- Machine Learning Models: **Random Forest**, **Decision Trees**, **Artificial Neural Networks**
- Anomaly Detection
- Clustering (K-Means) for consumption behavior
- Load Shifting Simulations
